# Sketch of comparison

```{r setup}
library(benchmark)
m1 = micro_readVcf()
m2 = micro_readGG() ...
m3 = micro_readGG( new dataset )
```

# Further plans

series of test intervals ... 22 16.05e6, 16.051e6  trivial ... 1k, 10k, 50k ... see if these take inordinately loong time

widths = c(1000, 1e4, 5e4)
vcfbench = list()
for (i in 1:length(width)) {
    vcfbench[[i]] = micro_readVcf( ... start = 16.05e6, end = 16.05e6 + width[[i]] )
    
GenomicRanges::tileGenome -- ultimately want concise approach to surveying a chromsome for all variants

wrap code of this type in methods on the objects like tiles and vcf instances and so on
